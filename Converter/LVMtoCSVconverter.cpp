    File Converter to Convert .lvm Files to .csv
    Leonid Pozdneev
    January 2019

    This program takes all .lvm files in the directory where it's run, formats the data in those files,
    and record the data in .csv files with the same names.

    NOTES:  This program is designed to convert .lvm files created by Data Logger utility in NI ELVISmx.
            Data Logger formats data in the following way: "<date stamp><double space><time stamp><\t><measurment>".
            This program works with data logged from both one and two inputs.
            The program WILL NOT WORK CORRECTLY if your .lvm files are formatted differently.

            ONLY WORKS ON WINDOWS 64-BITS (32-bit systems have not been tested).

            This is how data is formatted in .csv files:
            1) Tabs in the first column are replaced with commas.
            2) The date stamp is removed. (So if during your measurments the date changes, the times in the .csv file will not be correct,
            but that can be solved when you are processing your data.)
            3) The time stamp is converted into seconds, and the first measurment is taken as 0 seconds.
            (e.g. if your first measurment happened at 12:34:56.7, and the second measurment happened at 12:34:57.8, then in the .csv
            file, the first measurment will have time 0, and the second measurment will have time 1.1.)
            4) Columns are separated by commas.

    USAGE:  Place compiled .exe file of this .cpp into the directory with your .lvm files, and run the .exe (double click).
